I am on github to develop my web development skills so I can learn from the platforms and give whatever knowledge I have to the platform.
I am a newbie developer still learning but that's why I am here Hopefully I will get what i am in search for
I want to be expert in PHP coding hence github provides a perfect platform to get started
